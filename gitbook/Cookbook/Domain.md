# Domain

Put all your Domain specific code and business logic here.
It's recommended to model the folder structure here as you see fit for your project and often develops with time and deeper understanding of the target domain.

Example directories would be: Model, DTO, Service, Utility etc.

We still have to find out if the declaration of the Store is part of the Domain or part of the [Store](Redux/ReduxStore.md).
