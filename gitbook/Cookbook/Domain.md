# Domain

Put all your Domain specific code and business logic here (e.g. Models, DTOs, Services, Utilities).
The folder structure may differ from project to project and develops over time and deeper knowledge about the target domain.

Most of the domain specific functionality is then used in the Redux Store and Containers.
