# React TypeScript kickstart

This gitbook serves as a guide for kickstarting a new React project.

## TODO
These features are currently missing but will be added in due time:
* Storybook
* Enzyme & Jest
* Sass workflow

## Prerequisites

These tools are needed to start developing.

```bash
# nvm
brew install nvm

# node (latest lts version)
nvm install --lts

# yarn
brew install yarn --without-node

# install gitbook
yarn add -g gitbook

# install boilerplate creator globally
yarn add -g create-react-app react-scripts-ts
```

Furthermore I recommend to use [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as editor. Be shure to install the `TSLint` extension.

>You can install my personal extensions, settings, snippets etc with the `Settings Sync` extension. My public Gist ID is `89543bfc77af937a37916040a0dfad3c`.

## How to Read

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd repo

gitbook serve
```
